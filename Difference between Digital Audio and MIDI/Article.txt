Digital Audio: Binary data is used to represent sound in digital audio. It entails transforming analogue sound waves into a digital version that can be stored, handled, and transferred using digital technology.

MIDI: Using a common set of commands and messages, the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) protocol enables electronic musical instruments, computers, and other devices to communicate with one another. Instead of recording actual sound, it is a method of encoding musical notes and performance data as digital information.
